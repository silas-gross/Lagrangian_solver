## What is this branch?
This branch uses Theo's idea of creating classes for each type of function (symbolic or point).  A symbolic function would recieve a pointer 
to a function that is the base function and can then be evaluated for different values.  A point function would take a symbolic function and 
create a list of points based on it or a list of points and create a symbolic function based on it.  Not quite sure if this is what you 
wanted yet, but I know that I can get it working.
